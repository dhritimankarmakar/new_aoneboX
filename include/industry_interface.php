<p>We live in an era where we search for constant engagement and excitement. We always have that <b>FOMO (fear of missing out)</b> thing working within. We tirelessly and most of the time purposelessly explore social media. We actually buy products by accepting an onslaught of tailored ads in return. We need to invest in <b>top advertising agency in Kolkata</b> to use this weapon to generate a huge and long lasting market for our product or business. There are some ways that the advertising agencies follow to create a direct impact on the consumer life with your ads.</p>
<p>The advertisement company in Kolkata follow what the other people are doing and find a way that shows the decorative features of your product still summarizes the main motto of the same. For example most adverts of the chocolates show off how well it satisfies your taste bud. When Kitkat launched one of the most iconic ads of all time on 2000.</p>
<p>It projected the fundamental message <b>(Kitkat break banta hain)</b> by introducing the idea of the chocolate not only tasty but also relaxing. It was still spreading the tone of tasty chocolate which soothes your sweet tooth and added a realistic feature of relaxation while taking breaks in between. Hats off to the creative minds, who created this by totally subverting expectations being extremely relatable.</p>

<p>Planning of the <b>advertising agency in Kolkata</b> also includes introducing the versatility of the product. It simply means how the same product can be useful in different ways for different consumers. Broadband service providers have showcased how internet can be needed by all the family members for different works. Starting from studying to cooking, how it touches every corner of life.<p>
<p><b>Advertising Agency in Kolkata</b> points out the positivity in utter negative issues and thus create the need for the product among consumers. Who likes stains on their clothes? No one,right? But Surf excel came up with this idea of <b>Stains are good</b>. Simply explaining how stains are important for learning. Bang on!</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QdGSzpayJCM?si=jwdq9PM4FD1lHX16" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>The last and perhaps the most important, that the advertising agency in Kolkata add artistic value to the advertisement. They make the campaign look verbally and visually distinctive. Their artistic touch make the whole thing come to life graphically.</p>

<h4>Creativity what makes it memorable</h4>
<p>Creativity creates memories. Agreed? <b>Vodafone (Formerly Hutch)</b> came up with the campaign “Network that follows you” with a Pug following a little boy. I bet everyone can remember that dog from that advertisement and it gained immense popularity among crowds. This is the impact of <b>creative advertising agencies</b> that, they can move the consumer from advert to purchase by touching their life. The way to being memorable is to engage the consumers at a emotional level and this is where the <a href="https://www.aonebox.com/catalog-photoshoot-services-in-kolkata"><b>photoshoot agency in Kolkata</b></a> show their expertise.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-46Fj6H0R0w?si=ogvfwiU1IGni9ctZ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<h4>Creating powerful messages - advertisement company in Kolkata</h4>
<p><b>Branding & advertising agency in Kolkata</b> work towards creating powerful messages. It is hard to find a person who doesn’t know the tagline for <b>Amul - The taste of India</b>. The message has such power that the products didn’t only represent the brands identity but the voice of the Indians as well. <a href="https://www.aonebox.com/influencer-marketing-services"><b>Top Influencer Marketing Agency in Kolkata</b></a> figure out the most effective message for customers. They sometimes may run a survey to understand the consumer need and base the message on it.</p>

<h4>Advertisement company in Kolkata turn your story in a captivating one</h4>
<p><b>Top advertisement company in Kolkata</b> work towards creating a beautiful story for your products. They combine the features of the product, campaign goals and target message together. If you are wondering why a mind catching story is needed to create a memorable impression, then you need to again visit the ad created by <b>Fevicol</b> in 2000.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IzbSLQ8WQQc?si=zEWsujxqYN06d7cT" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Who can forget that curios cook trying to break an egg and could not do so. Then again, we knew why. Another example is the 25th anniversary celebration for Maggi. Through their campaign <b>Meri Maggi</b> and Me, they asked the consumer to share their story related to Maggi and this thing was a huge hit. The view for this ad hit 1.37 million in Youtube. Cadbury came up with the idea to help small businesses during the pandemic struck diwali that year.</p> 
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y_yHLbMPozU?si=00cJhgrNYqbvjGNV" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>We can go on with many examples, but we want your business or product to be added in this list of examples. These things need extensive brain storm sessions, efforts that are done by the <a href="https://www.aonebox.com/corporate-videoshoot-services-in-pune"><b>Corporate films & video prodution company</b></a>. It is a fact that without extra background work, the outcome maybe impressive but not long lasting.</p>

<h4>Brand love that can be taken to another level by creativity</h4>
<p>If your brand is a well known one and you are thinking that why do you need the help of advertising agency in Kolkata then maybe you have been living in a old world. In this rat race you need to be the tortoise. Slow but steady. And if you are not working on adding more and more creative ads to highlight the added features of your product, you are sure to get out of mind of the consumer.</p>
<p>If you are a fan of creative ads like us, you are sure to remember the ad created by <b>HP Laptops</b> (which is already a very widely accepted brand) in 2018 with <a href="https://www.aonebox.com/catalog-photoshoot-services-in-kolkata"><b>the campaign</b></a> <b>“Umeed ka diya”( light of hope)</b>. The motto of the campaign was to inspire people to go local for their Diwali shopping. It reminded the viewer to make someone’s Diwali brighter.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vl6rDId2DsY?si=W-mYBIH1qB9ENWQI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>At the time of the press, the video had recorded 2.4 million views with round 4400 comments and was shared 63,582 times on Facebook. Twitter started a trend on diwali that year with <b>#TuJashnBan</b>. In this whole thing, the brand Hp highlighted the new feature of their printer and created a vibe where consumer remembered it unknowingly.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Of1jF6ZQR_4?si=1pl9dUX9CECpfyni" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>When your brand is advertised via a <a href="https://www.aonebox.com/video-ad-production-house"><b>advertisement company</b></a>, your audience sees it in a different light. They view your brand as high-quality and worth their attention. And it’s simply because they love the creative twist in the campaign—this increases brand love. In concise, I can’t emphasize more on the need of <b>advertising agency in Kolkata</b> even if you are a popular brand.</p>

<h4>Branding & Advertising Agency in Kolkata using non-conventional ways</h4>
<p>Most of the organizations design their marketing expenses into driving sales. Money in versus money out. They concentrate on quick sales resulting from the campaign. The case study of Dettol (product of the UK giant Reckitt) shows us how incorporating quick solutions to an issue that is common to large population can be a breakthrough. In 2020 they came up with <b>"Dettol kills 99.9% of covid-19 germs”</b>. </p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oG9H10uCnq8?si=re0tNjjlZ7GJErkb" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>That is the thing people were looking for, any accessible solution to Covid-19 germs. Dettol recorded a revenue rising 11.9% to £6.9bn in the first half. This simply emphasizes that creativity definitely does have a positive correlation with revenue, in many more ways than we probably realize! The <b>advertising agency in Kolkata</b> who came up with this idea, take a vow!</p>
<h4>Creativity and revenue are linked-myth or reality?</h4>
<p><b>Best advertising company in Kolkata</b> can be the wheel of the chariot of your product. As already mentioned it creates a need among the population and help your sales graph to go higher. A review run a study conducted by Harvard Business School showed, that a euro spend in a highly creative ad campaign can work towards changing your investment and sales ratio. It can double the sales.  Also it proves that the impact of creativity was initially relatively small but typically gathered momentum as the campaign rolled out.</p>
<p>Concisely the <a href="https://www.aonebox.com/services-aonebox-media-company"><b> advertising company in Kolkata</b></a> help to combine the originality with flexibility to create high performing ads.  Most of us see a widely accepted creative ad and accept “Creativity is the king!’. This also draws a thin line between unbridled creativity and selling intent. To understand this difference we can say, with your experience in market you can try to design an ad yourself without the help of a top advertising agency in Kolkata. </p>
<p>And the ad can be a good one. But after sometimes, you notice that the sales are not taking off as expected, despite the ad being good. If an ad gains many shares and likes in social media but doesn’t contribute in raising the sales ration then it can be considered as a good ad but not a successful one. The advertising agency in Kolkata focus on not only great or creative ads but also attempts to fully understand the customer to which makes the difference.</p>
<p>As an example, <a href="https://www.aonebox.com/catalog-photoshoot-services-in-kolkata"><b>model photoshoot</b></a> is one of the very widely popular services offered by the  branding & advertising agency in Kolkata. Every product we buy or see has a story behind it. From the initial stage of making to the consumer bucket, it has its journey. A campaign videoshoot is a concept that plays a major part in this storytelling. It helps to capture or weave the story for consumers through different pictorial visualization.</p> 
<p>Sometimes it may need a model who can tell the story or sometimes you can design the concept in such a way that the product speaks for itself. By saying this, the whole concept can be divided into two parts. The first one, where the photos or the pictures are pretty straightforward and can jump off the pages and the other one is where the products are presented with a strong conceptual story.</p> 
<p>But one can choose to opt for both concepts depending on the product. The principal motto of a catalog photo shoot is to leave an enduring impression on the consumer's mind. The <b>advertisement company in Kolkata</b> help to make your product the center of attraction, they help you to customize the collection and make the audience believe that the product can make their life more vibrant.</p>
<p>They offer customized packages to create a balance between your need and budget. Their expertise in building up a positive image of the product and disciplined execution can help both B2B and B2C industries. Thus they help the product to reach more and more consumers and convince them in buying the same. It is needless to say that the more attractive and easy accessible the product is the more chances of selling and more rise to the revenue.</p>
